=== States and Enums

There are various states which are tracked through enum types for the models in the API. In addition
in order to control some of the vocabulary other enum types are used for Fixity Algorithm support.

Any enum  which is used on an API model will be defined in package `org.chronopolis.rest.models.enums`,
however some which are used as discriminator types (e.g. Bag Staging Type) may be found elsewhere.

==== Bag Status
{bag-status-url}[BagStatus.kt] | Describes the state which a Bag is in.

.BagStatus Enum Values
|===
| DEPOSITED | The Bag was registered with Ingest
| INITIALIZED | The Bag has had all Files and Fixity registered
| TOKENIZED | The Bag has had all ACE Tokens registered and written a Token Store to Ingest's
storage
| REPLICATING | Replications have been made for a set of Chronopolis Nodes
| PRESERVED | All Replications succeeded successfully
| DEPRECATED | The Bag is no longer actively tracked by ACE at each Chronopolis node
| DELETED | The Bag has been removed from disk at each Chronopolis Node
| ERROR | An error occurred while processing the Bag
|===

==== Replication Status
{replication-status-url}[ReplicationStatus.kt] | Describes the state a Replication is in

.ReplicationStatus Enum Values
|===
| PENDING | A Replication has been requested but not yet acted on
| STARTED | A Replication has been added to the queue to be worked on
| TRANSFERRED | Both the ACE Token Store and Bag have been transferred into a Chronopolis Node's
preservation storage
| ACE_REGISTERED | The Bag associated with the Replication has been registered in a Node's ACE AM
| ACE_TOKEN_LOADED | The Token Storage has been imported into a Node's ACE AM for the Bag
| ACE_AUDITING | The initial audit was triggered for the Bag in a Node's ACE AM
| SUCCESS | The initial audit passed indicating that no files were corrupt on transfer
| FAILURE | General failure of the replication
| FAILURE_TOKEN_STORE | The hash of the token store was incorrect after transfer
| FAILURE_TAG_MANIFEST | The hash of the Bag's tagmanifest was incorrect after transfer
| FAILURE_ACE_AUDIT | The audit had an error which was unable to be resolved
|===

==== Repair Status
{repair-status-url}[RepairStatus.kt] | Describes the state a Repair is in

.RepairStatus Enum Values
|===
| REQUESTED | A Repair was requested
| STAGING | A Repair was picked up for fulfillment and is being staged
at the Fulfilling Node
| READY | A Repair is ready to be transferred from the Fulfilling Node
| TRANSFERRED | A Repair was successfully transferred from the Fulfilling Node
| REPAIRED | A Repair operation completed successfully
| FAILED | A Repair operation was not able to be completed
|===

==== Audit Status
{audit-status-url}[AuditStatus.kt] | The state of an ACE AM audit for a Repair

.AuditStatus Enum Values
|===
| PRE | An audit is not yet ready to be triggered
| AUDITING | An audit is active
| SUCCESS | An audit succeeded
| FAIL | An audit failed
|===

==== Fulfillment Type
{fulfillment-type-url}[FulfillmentType.kt] | The different types of transfer workflows for fulfilling
a Repair

.FulfillmentType Enum Values
|===

| ACE | Fulfill a Repair through a remote ACE Audit Manager
| NODE_TO_NODE | Fulfill a repair through another Chronopolis Node
|===

==== Fixity Algorithm
{fixity-algorithm-url}[FixityAlgorithm.kt] | The supported hashing algorithms

.FixityAlgorithm Enum Values
|===

| SHA_256 | Identifier for the SHA-256 algorithm
| UNSUPPORTED | Indication that the algorithm found is not supported
|===

==== Data Type
{data-type-url}[DateType.kt] | The Data which a StorageRegion is holding

.DataType Enum Values
|===
| BAG | The StorageRegion is used for staging Bags
| TOKEN | The StorageRegion is used for staging ACE Token Stores
|===

==== Storage Type
{storage-type-url}[StorageType.kt] | Value for describing where a StorageRegion is located

.StorageType Enum Values
|===
| LOCAL | The StorageRegion is on a server local to the Chronopolis Node
|===

==== Storage Unit
{storage-unit-url}[StorageUnit.kt] | Basic byte units for simplifying form input

.StorageUnit Enum Values
|===
| B | Byte
| KiB | Kibibyte
| MiB | Mibibye
| GiB | Gibibyte
| TiB | Tebibyte
| PiB | Pebibyte
| OOB | Out of bounds
|===

==== Bag Staging Type
{bag-staging-url}[StagingDao.java] | Discriminator Strings for StagingStorage API paths

.Staging Enum Discriminators
|===
| BAG | The Staging used is for a Bag
| TOKEN_STORE | The Staging used is for an ACE Token Store
|===
